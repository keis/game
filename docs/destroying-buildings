a building X with child nodes is destroyed.

1)
	all child nodes are destroyed as well

	possibly overpowered punishment for having a building destroyed
		give defence boost to buildings with child nodes?
		make it cheap/easy to construct new buildings?

2)
	all child nodes are attached to the parent of X

	what if there is no room?
		a) try to move even higher up in the heirarchy (not always possible)
		b) attach to one of the other child nodes
		
		in both cases the result is a bit confusing and planning for this effect
	will require much thought

	no additional punishment for having a building destroyed
3)
	X is replaced with a placeholder, a ruin, and childnodes are kept in place

	little to no extra punishment for having a building destroyed

	possible to rebuild?
		nope
			fills tree with lots of useless placeholders
			puts new buildings further away from core => reduced healing etc
			
		only the same building
			very limiting, discourages adapting of tactic

		any building
			keep number of pads from original building
				possible to get around high-pad count nerf by building on top of a ruin

			only allow buildings with the same number of pads
				non obvious limitation (need fluff)
				limiting
			
			allow buildings with the same or lower number of pads. use number of pads from original
				non obvious limitation (need fluff)
				not-very limiting

			use pads from new building
				what about child nodes when fewer pads
