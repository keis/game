tactics that should not be favored by the rules.

* Zerg-rush of mana rubies
	building aggressive units early and attacking mana rubies disrupting the mana pool
of the other player.
	* Make defence buffs powerful at least in the early game
	* Make Mana rubies though without making them OP defence positions
	= High HP and increased HP regen but without a above average defence bonus.

* Boulder turtling
	building a wall of boulders around the initial buildings to avoid all
attacks while building a powerful library.
	* Make buildings worthwile
	* Make buildings outside the wall less attractive
	* Discourage early building of boulders by disrupting the library
	= Reduces the power of all passing AOE/Line abilities
	= All boulders are added to the library and can be focused.
