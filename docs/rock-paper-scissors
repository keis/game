A rock/paper/scissors situation is aimed for between the three main tactics.

Spells beats Creatures
Creatures beats Buildings
Buildings beats Spells

A spell based tactic is one where the main damage is dealt by casting spells to
	both units and buildings.
A creature based tactic is one where you summon lots of creatures or a few
	powerful ones and attack to bring down buildings.
A building based tactic is not as intuitive as the others. Buildings are
	passive in their nature only boosting units or spells. A tactic built around
	constructing buildings to give a huge boost to a small amount of units and/or
	is considered a building based tactic.

The goal of this layout is to force players into a more varied tactic as
limiting yourself to only one tactic will to easily be countered.
