1v1 turn based game

each player builds a base as a tree from the root (The Tower) by placing new
nodes (buildings). Each building type has a predefined number child nodes.
	Two basic actions exist; casting a spell and ordering unit -movement/attack
which can be performed in any number and any order per turn. However a unit may
only move once and a limited amount of mana and focused spells limits the number
of actions.

The LIBRARY consist of the spells the player have prepared and any tools put there
by buildings or units. At the start of the game and at the END of each players
turn 5 random items are put into focus. At the start of each players turn all
mana shards in focus will be converted to mana to be used for the turn. The
shards will still stay in focus but have no other effect. When a focused spell
is cast it will be removed from focus. Items may also be removed from focus by a
DISCARD effect. When a item loses focus it's re-added to the library.

Area of effect (AOE) applies a effect to a node and its child nodes with a per
effect specific reducing per step.
E.G Core Tower repair (100,-20%):
	consider a tree: Tower -> Mana Ruby 1 -> Boulder -> House 1
						   -> Mana Ruby 2 -> House 2 -> House 3
	Core Tower will regain 100 HP (100)
	Mana Ruby 1 and 2 will regain 80 + 40 = 120 HP (80)
	Boulder will receive 0 HP (64)
	House 1 will regain 30 HP
	House 2 will regain 64 HP
	House 3 will regain 51 HP

Line effect (LE) applies a effect to a node and all nodes between and including a
leaf node in the start nodes subtree. With a possible reduce/increase for each
step.
E.G Super Mega Magic Nuke (100, +50%)
	LOL NAMES
	consider a tree Tower -> Mana Ruby -> Magic Amplifier -> House -> Magic Launcher
	power at tower: 100
	at mana ruby: 100 + 50 = 150
	at magic amp.: 150 + 75 + 100 = 325
	at house: 325 + 487
	at launcher: 730.5 + 730.5 = 1461
